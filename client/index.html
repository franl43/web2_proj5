                Rodeo, sport involving a series of riding and roping contests derived from the working skills of the
                American cowboy as developed during the second half of the 19th century to support the open-range cattle
                industry in North America. Although its development as a sport occurred mainly in northern Mexico, the
                United States, and western Canada, rodeo’s popularity is global. In particular, many similar events and
                competitions can be found in South America, including the coleo of Venezuela and Colombia. The charreada
                of Mexico is a similar competition that evolved from the haciendas of colonial Mexico; its rodeo-like
                events are typically not timed but judged in terms of artistic merit.

            <h3>Origins and history</h3>
            <p>
                Rodeos (from the Spanish rodear, “to encircle”) grew out of the work and play of 19th-century American
                cowboys and their Spanish-Mexican antecedents. They evolved from a time when cowboys would gather
                together during seasonal roundups or in the “cow towns” at the end of cattle-driving trails and vie for
                the unofficial title of best bucking-horse rider, roper, and so on. As the cowboys’ occupation was
                curtailed in scope by the railroads and by the fences that marked the end of the Open Range era, the
                contests became regular formal programs of entertainment. Many locales claim the distinction of being
                the first place to hold a rodeo in the United States—among them Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 1872 and Winfield,
                Kansas, in 1882—but such early contests were merely exhibitions of riding and roping skills and not the
                highly organized shows that modern rodeo became. Starting in the 1880s, various Wild West shows
                presented “cowboy tournaments” around the United States, associating the demonstration of western
                open-range practices with sporting performance. Prescott, Arizona Territory, held the first annual rodeo
                on July 4, 1888. Organized by a town committee, it included public advertising, admission charges, and
                championship prizes, establishing the venue as a true competitive spectator sport. Prescott was followed
                by major annual rodeo venues such as Cheyenne Frontier Days (1897), the Pendleton (Oregon) Round-Up
                (1910), and the Calgary Stampede (1912).
                Under the management of promoters, contractors, and civic-minded local committees, rodeo emerged as a
                legitimate independent sport by 1910. It was among the most egalitarian of American sports in the early
                20th century, often including Hispanic, African American, Native American, and female contestants in an
                era when race and gender discrimination were commonplace. For example, Mexican trick- and fancy-roper
                Vicente Oropeza and famed black bronc-rider and steer-wrestler Bill Pickett won acclaim in the arena, as
                did Native American bronc-riders Tom Three Persons and Jackson Sundown. A number of female competitors,
                such as Lucille Mulhall and Bertha Blancett, also won acclaim in the early days of rodeo, sometimes
                competing directly with men. In 1929 the Rodeo Association of America, an organization of rodeo managers
                and producers, was formed to regulate the sport. The contestants themselves took a hand in 1936 after a
                strike in Boston Garden and organized the Cowboy Turtles Association—“turtles” because they had been
                slow to act. That group was renamed the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA) in 1945 and the Professional
                Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) in 1975, and its rules became accepted by most rodeos.
                After World War II, rodeo experienced an explosion in venues, monetary rewards, spectator attendance,
                and national publicity. The sport’s competitor ranks grew through participation of athletes from the
                National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA), founded in 1948, and as a result of the annual
                National Finals Rodeo (NFR), which was established in 1959 and became the richest and most prestigious
                rodeo in the world. At the turn of the 21st century, some 600 PRCA-sanctioned rodeos were held annually
                in some 40 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces. The sport’s top-ranking, highly paid contenders
                compete to qualify for the National Finals and to win the title of world all-around champion cowboy,
                given to the PRCA participant earning the most prize money in a year.

            <h3>Rodeo structure</h3>
            <p>
                Contemporary rodeos typically present five main events. Two of these—saddle-bronc riding and calf
                roping—represent the practical range work of the 19th-century cowboy. Three other primary
                contests—bareback-bronc riding, steer wrestling, and bull riding—appeared as feats of cowboy daring
                during the first decades of the 20th century. Most prominent rodeos also include women’s barrel racing
                and team steer roping as regular program events. Steer roping, a traditional cowboy practice and a
                familiar rodeo event for several decades in the early 1900s, is today an infrequent competition because
                of considerations of animal welfare.
                The competitions typically are defined as “judged,” or “rough-stock,” events (saddle-bronc riding,
                bareback-bronc riding, and bull riding) and “timed” events (steer wrestling, calf roping, team roping,
                barrel racing, and steer roping). In the former events, judges score the performance of contestants and
                animals alike for a potential total tally of 100 points per ride. In the latter events, competitors race
                against the clock through a series of go-rounds for the fastest (lowest) cumulative time. Most
                PRCA-sanctioned rodeos present in a specific order: bareback riding leads off, followed by calf roping,
                saddle-bronc riding, steer wrestling, team roping, barrel racing, and, as the grand finale, bull riding.
                Rodeos for many years featured competitive events that are no longer a regular part of venue
                programming. Most prominent among those were trick and fancy roping and trick riding. Based on Wild West
                show antecedents, trick ropers and riders thrilled crowds at major rodeos for years, but they then
                dwindled from prominence as their skills were relegated to the status of contract performances in the
                early 1930s. Some rodeos still present those skills but as contract rather than as competitive events.
                Although women competed in many rough-stock events at mixed-gender rodeos well into the 1930s, today
                they pursue those contests in rodeos organized by the Women’s Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA),
                founded in 1948. Barrel racing is the sole women’s event regularly practiced at most PRCA-sanctioned
                rodeos.

        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Bareback-bronc riding</h3>
            <p>
                Bareback-bronc riding developed as an arena contest in the 1910s. (A bronc [bronco, broncho, or bucking
                bronco] is an unbroken range horse picked for its resistance to training and its tendency to buck, or
                throw, its rider.) This event gained favour as rodeo venues installed side-opening arena chutes and as
                cowboys adopted the standard Bascom rigging—a surcingle (strap) with a single riveted handhold, or
                “suitcase handle.” Bareback riding became a standard event at the majority of sanctioned rodeos in the
                1950s. The contestant must spur the animal over the shoulders as it leaves the chute (“marking out”),
                and the contestant’s free hand must not touch the animal, the rigging, or the contestant’s own body.
                Qualifying rides last eight seconds, and scoring is based on a cumulative total of up to 50 points each
                for the performance of the bronc and the rider. Competitive scores usually exceed 80 points.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Calf roping</h3>
            <p>
                Calf roping, today usually referred to as tie-down roping, evolved directly from the traditional tasks
                of the roundup, when calves were roped and subdued for branding and doctoring. A timed event, it pits
                the contestant and his or her well-trained horse against the clock and a 250- to 350-pound (about 110-
                to 160-kg) calf. With a designated head start, the calf bursts from the chute and trips a barrier that
                signals pursuit by the roper. As the horse overtakes the calf, the contestant must rope it around the
                neck and simultaneously bring the horse to an abrupt stop, halting the calf’s flight while dismounting.
                The horse keeps a taut rope while the contestant runs to the calf, throws it on its side, and ties three
                legs securely with a “piggin’ string.” Time is declared when the roper throws up his or her hands after
                the tie-down. For a qualified time, the calf must stay tied for six seconds after the contestant has
                remounted and slackened the catch rope. If the contestant breaks the start barrier, a 10-second penalty
                is added.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Saddle-bronc riding</h3>
            <p>
                Saddle-bronc riding is the classic rough-stock competition of rodeos past and present, having evolved
                from the traditional horse-breaking tasks of the 19th-century cowboy. A judged event, saddle-bronc
                riding requires strength and balance on the part of the contestant, who has to stay atop a 1,200-pound
                (545-kg) bucking horse for the eight-second qualifying time. The standard riding equipment consists of a
                hornless saddle and a plain halter with a 6-foot (1.8-metre) braided rein. To make a qualifying score,
                the contestant must leave the chute with his or her spurs over the shoulders of the horse; the
                contestant’s feet must remain in the stirrups, and the contestant’s free hand cannot touch the horse,
                the saddle, or the contestant’s body. Event scoring combines a total of up to 50 points apiece for horse
                and rider; winning scores typically exceed 80 combined points, while 85 or above represents a superior
                ride.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Steer wrestling</h3>
            <p>
                Steer wrestling, also called bulldogging, is strictly a rodeo contest; real working cowboys never
                practiced it on the range. American cowboy Bill Pickett first performed the feat in the early 1900s,
                biting the animal’s nose to gain control before pulling it to the ground. The modern contestant omits
                the biting technique in favour of momentum, leverage, and strength. A timed event, steer wrestling
                combines good horsemanship, expert timing, and muscle to bring down a 550- to 650-pound (250- to 295-kg)
                steer from a running steed. As with roping events, the steer is released with a designated head start,
                tripping a barrier that allows the steer wrestler and a partner, the “hazer,” to pursue at the gallop.
                The hazer keeps the steer on a straight run while the contestant jumps onto the steer’s head and neck,
                grasps its horns, and then goes to the ground, planting his heels to brake the run. Once the steer
                slows, the bulldogger wrestles it to the ground with a twisting and falling motion. Time is declared
                when the steer lands on its side with all four legs extended in the same direction. A 10-second penalty
                is added for breaking the start barrier.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Team roping</h3>
            <p>
                Team roping first appeared among the cowboys of Arizona and California, becoming a regular rodeo
                competition at the Prescott Frontier Days in 1919. It came into wider vogue in the 1950s, and by the
                early 21st century it was contested as a standard event at PRCA-sanctioned rodeos. Like the other roping
                events, the steer is given a predetermined head start, after which the two contestants pursue. The
                leading roper, or “header,” must catch the steer about the horns, dally his or her rope (i.e., wrap it
                around the saddle horn one or more times), and change the direction of the steer’s run to benefit the
                throw of the other roper. This roper, the “heeler,” then ropes the steer’s back feet, dallies his or her
                rope, and stops the horse. Time is marked as the steer is immobilized between the two horses, both
                facing the steer in a straight line. Penalties of 10 and 5 seconds, respectively, are added for breaking
                the start barrier and for catching only one hind foot.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Barrel racing</h3>
            <p>
                Barrel racing is the only women’s event regularly featured at contemporary PRCA-sanctioned rodeos. The
                contest came to prominence in the early 1950s through the Girls Rodeo Association (later renamed the
                Women’s Professional Rodeo Association). Often ranked second only to bull riding in popularity, this
                timed event combines superb horsemanship with breakneck speed. Contestants have a running start,
                entering the arena and tripping the clock at the gallop. They must negotiate a cloverleaf pattern of
                three barrels and then ride all-out to exit and stop the clock. Riders may use spurs and crop to urge
                the horse to greater speed, but finesse in turning the barrels is equally important. Tipping a barrel
                adds a five-second penalty to the time, while running an incorrect pattern disqualifies the rider.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Bull riding</h3>
            <p>
                Bull riding began in the 1910s as open-arena steer riding. Not until the early 1930s, when arena chutes
                came into wide use, did the larger Brahman and crossbred bulls make an appearance. This event pits the
                competitor against a bull of 1,700–2,000 pounds (770–910 kg). To stay on the animal, the rider utilizes
                only a flat-plaited rope with a handhold and an attached bell; one hand remains free. Most contemporary
                bull riders wear Kevlar vests for protection, and some also don helmets. For a qualified ride,
                contestants must stay aboard the animal for eight seconds out of the chute and cannot touch the bull or
                themselves with their free hand. As in other judged events, the score is a combined tally of up to 50
                points each for rider and bull. Competitive scores range above 80 combined points, with 90 or better
                representing an exceptional ride.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Steer roping</h3>
            <p>
                Steer roping, though a rather limited event today, was a time-honoured practice among old-time cowboys.
                Working the range alone, a hand often had to catch and immobilize an animal weighing 400 to 600 pounds
                (about 180 to 270 kg) by himself. Referred to at early rodeos as “jerk down” roping, or “fairgrounding,”
                steer roping is a timed event that resembles calf roping—except that the animal is considerably larger
                and heavier and, after the catch, is thrown in a tripping maneuver. Once the steer frees the start
                barrier, the contestant must pursue, rope, trip, and tie down the animal against the clock. Time is
                called when the contestant throws his or her hands in the air, but the steer must remain tied for six
                seconds after the contestant remounts and slackens the catch rope. As in other timed events, a 10-second
                penalty is added if the contestant breaks the start barrier. Because of the violent tripping motion of
                this event, steers are sometimes killed or injured in the arena. Owing to public complaints and the
                influence of animal rights organizations, steer roping has been outlawed in most states in the western
                U.S. Today the contest is sharply curtailed, typically being conducted as a singular event or as a match
                roping between only two contestants.
